Step 1 after creating the repo and setting up
the branches you want is setting branch protection rules.
Branching itself is an interesting topic of much debate
I was convinced by the Software Engineering at Google that always commit to main and no feature branches
was best practice. 
However all corporations I have worked in for tbe past 20 years use branches.
If you choose just to have a main branch, 
you just dont get many of the tickbox branch protection rules that are in market leading products now

From a devsecops perspective, you have to enable what I'm saying on commit checks like google does
with its static code analysis

In Github you may as well enable all tickbox branch protections and two approvers, no
admin overwrite on at least your main and release branches

In the article I talked about:
Chose what severity of bugs you allow into specific environments - e.g. you can commit whatever you have written to local and run unit tests. 
You can commit everything except CVSS 9.0+ bugs to the server. 
You can only commit or merge code with CVSS 4.0 or lower bugs to the Main branch or deploy to “Production”. 
Use things like system criticality and the good old CIA triad in addition to CVSS
